#### **Writing a Blog as Part of Your Pinternship Journey with VLED Lab**
<small>*(Activity: Call for Blogs)*</small>

As part of your internship with the **VLED Lab**, we are opening a **Call for Blogs**—an invitation for you to pause, reflect, and put your journey into words. This activity is not about technical writing skills or perfect grammar. It is about **capturing your experience honestly**, in your own voice, as you lived through this internship.

#### **The Journey**

This internship has been intentionally designed as a learning journey rather than a checklist. You began with a fully hands-on **MERN stack course delivered through ViBe**, where learning happened through practice and persistence. You then moved into solving **case studies**, which required you to think, reason, and struggle like a developer. This was followed by a **viva**, where your understanding and clarity were tested through conversation rather than code alone. For those who cleared the viva, the journey extended further—into **real project work alongside our developers**, where learning became responsibility.
Along the way, many experiences quietly shaped you. Learning on ViBe, submitting code regularly, navigating case studies, attending sessions consistently, discussing ideas in breakout rooms, preparing for the viva, receiving feedback, and working in teams—each of these meant something different to each of you. That difference is what makes your story worth telling.
To help you reflect, you may think about experiences such as learning through ViBe, working through the MERN course, solving case studies, handling coding submissions, participating in breakout room discussions, understanding the role of attendance and consistency, facing the viva, or contributing to real projects. These are only prompts to help you remember. Do not pick any of these as your blog topic directly. Writing on the “easiest” idea is not the goal. Writing from your heart is.

What we are **not looking for** is a summary of the internship or a step-by-step description of what happened.

What we **are looking for** is your lived experience—your doubts, your growth, your surprises, and your takeaways. Write about what stayed with you after the sessions ended. Write about moments that changed how you think or learn. Write as if you are speaking to someone who has never experienced learning in this way.

#### **Review, Feedback, and Publication**

All submitted blogs will be **reviewed by the VLED Lab team**. You will receive **comments and suggestions to help you improve your writing and clarity**. This is part of the learning process—we see writing as something that evolves through feedback, just like code.

Blogs that are selected after review will be **published on the Pinternship website under the Blogs section**. Additionally, **selected blogs will be recognised for their** thoughtful reflection, originality, and authenticity.

#### **Submission Instructions**

You are required to write your blog in **Markdown format** and push it to the **Pinternship** GitHub repository as a new pull request. Your blog will be rendered as a webpage, so ensure it is readable, well-structured, and personal. Follow the folder structure and naming conventions provided below. Each blog must be written individually and should reflect your own journey.

***Repository:*** [https://github.com/sudarshansudarshan/pinternship](https://github.com/sudarshansudarshan/pinternship)

***Folder Structure:*** Place your blog in the `Blogs/` folder.

***Naming Convention***
Your file must be named: `Name_PinternshipID.md`, *Example:* `Mohit_Pinternship12345.md`
