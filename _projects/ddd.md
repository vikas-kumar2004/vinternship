## **Project Overview**

DDD is a comprehensive performance and engagement dashboard that provides real-time insights into user activity, progress, and achievements across the entire platform. Rather than being standalone, DDD integrates into all other projects (ViBe, Spandan, Peer Evaluation), providing unified analytics that motivates users through gamification and visual feedback.

## **Key Features**

DDD delivers real-time performance tracking with interactive charts and data visualizations. Users earn achievements, build streaks, and progress through levels as they engage with platform features. Progress indicators and milestones show users how far they've come and what they're working toward. The system provides personalized insights tailored to each user's activity patterns, along with motivational feedback and rewards that sustain engagement.

## **Technologies Used**

Built with React and TypeScript on the frontend, Express.js and Node.js on the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. Chart.js and D3.js power the interactive visualizations.

## **Integration Approach**

DDD embeds as a modular component within each project. In ViBe, it tracks video engagement, completion rates, and learning patterns. In Spandan, it monitors class participation, question responses, and interaction frequency. For Peer Evaluation, it analyzes evaluation activity, feedback quality, and review completeness.

## **Project Goals**

DDD creates a unified dashboard bringing together all user activities across platforms. Through engaging gamification mechanics, it keeps users motivated while providing actionable performance insights. The system enables cross-project analytics, allowing users and administrators to see patterns spanning multiple applications.
