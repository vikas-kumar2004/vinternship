## **Project Overview**

Spandan transforms live teaching sessions into engaging learning experiences. The system captures teacher speech in real-time, converts it into transcripts, automatically generates relevant questions from the content, and presents them to students through a dedicated portal for instant interaction and assessment.

## **Key Features**

Spandan captures teacher speech in real-time and converts it into accurate transcripts. AI automatically generates relevant questions from these transcripts, creating instant engagement opportunities. Students access questions through a dedicated portal to submit answers during or after class. The platform enables true live interaction, making classes dynamic and participatory. Everything is tracked—questions generated and student responses—giving teachers a complete view through their dashboard to monitor engagement and identify areas needing clarification.

## **Technologies Used**

Frontend: React, TypeScript. Backend: Express.js, Node.js. Database: MongoDB. Speech Recognition: OpenAI Whisper, ASR. Question Generation: Open source LLM models.

## **Project Goals**

Spandan enables seamless real-time classroom interaction, transforming passive lectures into active learning. Automating question generation removes the burden from teachers to constantly create engagement prompts while teaching. The platform provides instant engagement and feedback, allowing teachers to gauge understanding immediately rather than waiting for formal assessments. Tracking participation throughout sessions helps identify engaged students and those needing support. Creating accessible transcripts serves multiple purposes—students can review material, those who missed class can catch up, and teachers can reflect on their teaching.
