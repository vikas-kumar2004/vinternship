## **Project Overview**

ViBe is a comprehensive Learning Management System revolutionizing education through video-based and multimedia content delivery. The platform integrates AI-powered proctoring to ensure academic integrity while providing an engaging, interactive learning environment. ViBe combines online learning flexibility with security and monitoring features necessary for assessments and examinations.

## **Key Features**

ViBe delivers rich multimedia content through interactive video modules forming the core learning experience. AI proctoring uses facial recognition and behavior analysis to automatically monitor exams, ensuring integrity without human proctors. The course management system handles everything from course creation and student enrollment to detailed progress tracking.

Assessment tools cover the full spectrum—quizzes, assignments, and examinations—with automated grading providing immediate feedback. Progress analytics give students and instructors detailed visibility into performance and engagement patterns. During examinations, AI-monitored testing environments actively prevent cheating. Students access everything through a personalized dashboard visualizing their progress. Instructors have tools for content creation, student management, and grading integrated into a single streamlined interface.

## **Technologies Used**

Frontend: React, TypeScript. Backend: Express.js, Node.js. Database: MongoDB. AI Proctoring: Computer vision and deep learning models detecting unusual eye movements, multiple faces, and prohibited materials.

## **Project Goals**

ViBe builds a full-featured LMS with a video-first approach, recognizing video as the most engaging way to deliver educational material. Implementing reliable AI proctoring addresses a major online education challenge—maintaining exam integrity without human proctors. The platform creates intuitive interfaces ensuring technology enhances rather than hinders learning. Scalable video content delivery handles growing numbers of students and courses without performance degradation. Comprehensive analytics provide actionable insights into learning progress. Maintaining academic integrity through automated monitoring ensures certifications and grades carry real weight and credibility.
