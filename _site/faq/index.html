## 11. Viva/PES (Endorsements)

**11.1 How will the viva/evaluation process be conducted?**  
Each participant is required to **select at least 5 evaluators (other participants)** who will evaluate their work, primarily based on their **case studies** solutions. Hence, make sure you are completed with all the Case studies before you evaluate someone or get evaluated yourself.

**11.2 What is the role of the evaluators?**  
The evaluators are expected to be **sincere** and give their **best effort** while evaluating the case studies.  
The evaluation is mainly an **endorsement of learning**, not a formal grading process.

**11.3 Will the evaluations be verified?**  
Yes. The team will **randomly second-check** evaluated case studies.  
If any **anomaly** is detected, the following actions may be taken:
- Re-evaluation of the evaluated participant's case studies  
- Re-evaluation of the evaluator’s own case studies  
- Re-evaluation of all case studies previously evaluated by that evaluator  

To avoid such an **anomaly cascade**, choose your evaluators carefully.

**11.4 Can two participants evaluate each other?**  
No. If **A evaluates B**, then **B cannot evaluate A**.

**11.5 Can I choose evaluators from my own institute?**  
Preferably, **no**.  
Choosing evaluators from your own institute may raise a **first level of suspicion**. While this is **discouraged**, it is **not enforced as a strict rule**.

**11.6 How many evaluators do I need?**  
You need **exactly 5 evaluators to endorse you**.  
If any selected person is unwilling to endorse you, you must **find a replacement**.  
Overall, you must ensure that **at least 5 people endorse your learning**.

**11.7 What does the endorsement involve?**  
Your evaluators will fill out a **Google Form** stating that they **endorse your learning**.  
- There is **no rating or scoring**
- Evaluators may add **optional comments**
- Endorsements will be submitted through a form that will be **displayed on the dashboard**

**11.8 When should the evaluation be done?**  
It is recommended to evaluate **only after completing all case studies** or once you are **confident in the concepts**.

**11.9 Do we need to record our evaluation interactions?**  
No. You only need to **interact and endorse** the person.  
How you conduct the interaction is **entirely up to you**. No recordings are required.

**11.10 Can I appeal an endorsement decision?**  
No.  
This is intentional, as participants are expected to choose **trustworthy evaluators** who will endorse them **honestly and fairly**.

**11.11 Can I evaluate more than 5 people?**  
Yes.  
You must be evaluated by **exactly 5 people**, but you may **evaluate as many participants as you wish**.

**11.12 What if I want to remove an endorsement or someone endorses me without my consent?**  
You will be provided with a **separate form** that allows you to **remove an endorsement** made by a particular person.

**11.13 What if I evaluate many people but struggle to find evaluators for myself?**  
The teaching team **appreciates participants who evaluate many peers**.  
In such cases, **teaching team members** can be requested to act as your evaluators.

Additionally, **Silver and Golden Tickets** will be issued to selected participants.  
- Participants receiving these tickets **do not need peer evaluation**
- They will be **directly evaluated by Sudarshan sir and the teaching team**
- Anyone who endorses **more than 25 people** will be evaluated by the Teaching Team and will be issued a Silver Ticket.

**11.14 How do I earn a Silver ticket?**  
Anyone who endorses **more than 25 people** will be evaluated by the Teaching Team and will be issued a Silver Ticket.
